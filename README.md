Introduction:
=============

A website that offers a platform for anyone to sell their goods directly to a distributor or a consumer

This is our submission for Hack36's 'Local for Vocal' theme.Due to a lack of verification and authorization, both sellers and buyers face a slew of issues with fraud, quality assurance, delivery, and communication channels. Our website allows both parties to confirm that the item has been received/given. 
Online shopping often involves scams where scammers pretending to be legitimate online sellers on a genuine retailer site. While many online sellers are legitimate, unfortunately scammers can use the anonymous nature of the internet to rip off unsuspecting shoppers. There will be no middlemen on our website, and all communication will be direct between the buyer and the seller.
